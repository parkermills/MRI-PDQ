PDQ is a set of MATLAB functions for detecting sphere-shaped deposits of magnetically susceptible material (i.e., magnetic dipoles) in MRI datasets, measuring their magnetic moment. Deposits of interest include SPIO-labeled cells and magnetocapsules.
<br /><br />
Unpublished results suggest that PDQ is effective at distinguishing contrast due to dipoles from other intrinsic sources of hypointensity.
<br /><br />
Publications that describe PDQ's function and exhibit results include:
<br /><br />
1) Sensitive and automated detection of iron-oxide-labeled cells using phase image cross-correlation analysis. (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/qzora7a">http://tinyurl.com/qzora7a</a>)
<br />
2) Automated detection and characterization of SPIO-labeled cells and capsules using magnetic field perturbations (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/bvomtde">http://tinyurl.com/bvomtde</a>)
<br /><br />
PDQ was developed in Ahrens Lab, Pittsburgh NMR Center for Biomedical Research, Carnegie Mellon University. Financial support was provided in part by the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
<br /><br />
Features:
<br />
<ul>
<li>Detects magnetic dipoles in MRI datasets</li>
<li>Estimates magnetic dipole moment for detected dipoles</li>
<li>Eliminates unreasonable dipole moments (e.g., too-weak dipoles found in noise, or too-strong dipoles found in air bubbles)</li>
<li>Automatically masks out noise by fitting magnitude image to Rician &amp; Gaussian distribution</li>
<li>Works with non-isotropic datasets</li>
<li>Processes multiple datasets, comparing dipoles quantitatively across them</li>
<li>Calculates number of dipoles vs. distance from regions of interest (ROIs)</li>
<li>Experimental: Estimates iron content within magnetic dipoles</li>
<li>Experimental: Registers dipoles between different time points</li>
<li>Experimental: Estimates dipole movements between different time points</li>
<li>Experimental: Estimate 'best-fit' sphere radius for each dipole.</li>
<li>Advanced: Detection templates: Detect dipoles located off-center of voxel boundaries; Simulate randomly-distributed spins to eliminate aliasing.</li>
</ul>
