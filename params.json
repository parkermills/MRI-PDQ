{"name":"MRI-PDQ","tagline":"Detect sphere-shaped paramagnetic deposits in MRI datasets","body":"PDQ is a set of MATLAB functions for detecting sphere-shaped deposits of magnetically susceptible material (i.e., magnetic dipoles) in MRI datasets, measuring their magnetic moment. Deposits of interest include SPIO-labeled cells and magnetocapsules.\r\n\r\nUnpublished results suggest that PDQ is effective at distinguishing contrast due to dipoles from other intrinsic sources of hypointensity.\r\n\r\nPublications that describe PDQ's function and exhibit results include:\r\n\r\n1) Sensitive and automated detection of iron-oxide-labeled cells using phase image cross-correlation analysis. (http://tinyurl.com/qzora7a)\r\n\r\n2) Automated detection and characterization of SPIO-labeled cells and capsules using magnetic field perturbations (http://tinyurl.com/bvomtde)\r\n\r\nPDQ was developed in Ahrens Lab, Pittsburgh NMR Center for Biomedical Research, Carnegie Mellon University. Financial support was provided in part by the U.S. National Institutes of Health.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n* Detects magnetic dipoles in MRI datasets\r\n* Estimates magnetic dipole moment for detected dipoles\r\n* Eliminates unreasonable dipole moments (e.g., too-weak dipoles found in noise, or too-strong dipoles found in air bubbles)\r\n* Automatically masks out noise by fitting magnitude image to Rician & Gaussian distribution\r\n* Works with non-isotropic datasets\r\n* Processes multiple datasets, comparing dipoles quantitatively across them\r\n* Calculates number of dipoles vs. distance from regions of interest (ROIs)\r\n* Experimental: Estimates iron content within magnetic dipoles\r\n* Experimental: Registers dipoles between different time points\r\n* Experimental: Estimates dipole movements between different time points\r\n* Experimental: Estimate 'best-fit' sphere radius for each dipole.\r\n* Advanced: Detection templates: Detect dipoles located off-center of voxel boundaries; Simulate randomly-distributed spins to eliminate aliasing.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
